# Eva’s Birth Story

This is the story of Eva’s birth. All this time flew by so fast, it feels like everything just happened yesterday, and this is surely the most precious experience in my life. 

This story starts from a day in 2015, after we celebrated our 2-year anniversary on Zuma Beach in Malibu, we decided that we were going to have a baby.

In the early summer of 2015, we went to Lake Tahoe for a long, relaxing vacation. Little did we know that it would be our last chance as a family of two to be traveling outside Southern California.

In the following few weeks our wish was granted, double lines on the pregnancy test kit! We were stoked to be adding one more to our little family of two.

Soon after, I started experiencing some really bad morning sickness. To add some exercise to my daily routine, I started walking around the lake in our community every day.

When I saw the 0.696 cm little life and heard the baby’s heartbeat through a sonogram machine for the first time, I almost cried. Actually, I did really cry.

When I was 20 weeks pregnant, we went to the Ventura Beach and took one set of big-belly photos as a sweet memory.

After wondering for a long time, we finally found out through ultrasound that we were having a baby girl.

We spent a lot of time shopping for baby things, also prepared a cute nursery for her, hoping that she would like it.

My husband also did a lot of home lighting projects, wishing to make her world a little more colorful.

Two weeks before the due date, my belly almost reached its biggest size. It was difficult to sleep because the baby was pressing my heart and lungs. As we got closer to the due date, every day we are anxious to meet our baby face to face.

The following weekend, just a few nights before my due date, I started experiencing contractions. I woke up my husband, and we rushed to the ER at 4 a.m. After being in labor for around 16 hours, the doctor told us that the baby was OP, meaning she was facing the wrong way. I was taken to the surgery room for an emergency c-section.

When the nurse brought the baby to me, I know I have got the best gift in my life. We gave her a beautiful name, *Eva Mei*, and this day was Eva’s first day outside the womb.

And just like that, we had our first family photo.

During and after the epidural anesthesia, I was shivering badly. It felt like I was going to die. But when I finally held her in my arm, it felt like everything was worth it.

In the first few days of Eva’s life, I almost couldn’t move and the breast milk handn't kicked in yet.Due to which, Eva was also having trouble latching on. To avoid nipple confusion, my husband had to feed her formula with syringe just like feeding a little kitty.

After three long days and long nights our hospital stay was over. We took our precious little baby home in the infant car seat.

I changed my vanity (*beauty station*, as we call it) into pumping station. I started pumping every few hours to boost breast milk production. From a few drops of colostrum in the beginning, to a few hundred milliliters of milk after a few weeks, I was making some really good progress.

Since then, Eva has been exclusively breast fed. Knowing that she is gaining weight and length well, we are extremely pleased. When Eva grows up and asks me how she was born, I will show this story to her and make her understand how much daddy and mommy love her. This is just the beginning of our new life as a family of three. We know we are going go through a lot in the future, and will have a lot of stories to tell. We will always support each other, because we are a family!
